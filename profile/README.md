# Welcome to the ICG Research Software Engineering (RSE) Team!

üëã We are a team of dedicated Research Software Engineers at the ICG, passionate about creating high-quality, sustainable, and impactful software for research.

Our mission is to empower researchers by providing the software engineering expertise needed to tackle complex scientific challenges. We collaborate closely with research groups to design, develop, and maintain the software that underpins modern scientific discovery.

## What We Do

Our work is diverse, but it's all centered around enabling better research through better software. Here are some of the things we do:

-   **üíª Develop Research Software:** We build robust and scalable software tools, from data analysis pipelines and simulations to web applications and visualization libraries.
-   **ü§ù Collaborate on Projects:** We embed within research projects, acting as partners to provide crucial software engineering skills.
-   **üìö Promote Best Practices:** We champion and provide training on software development best practices, including version control (Git), automated testing, and continuous integration.
-   **üí° Provide Consultation:** We offer expert advice and support to researchers on all aspects of their software development lifecycle.
